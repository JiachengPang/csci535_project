One has a pleading tone highlighting inner turmoil, while the other focuses on irritation and impatience. I’m wondering if they’re similar despite these nuances. Both convey a sense of negative tension and frustration, although their tones differ. The core emotion is frustration tied to tension, so I think they're similar enough in that regard. Also, they both exhibit a clipped and brisk cadence, which reinforces that connection. So, I'd say it’s a match!",
